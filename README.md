## Description
FitPrzepisy is an iOS mobile app written in SwiftUI. The app allows you
to browse recipes, add them to favorites, share them with friends and
add ingredients to your shopping list. The shopping list we have in the
app looks and behaves like a simple "todo" app.

I've always wanted to create a simple yet helpful app with healthy
recipes for people who need it. In addition, I could practice SwiftUI
techonology and learn new things. I want to improve the application and
release it in AppStore.
